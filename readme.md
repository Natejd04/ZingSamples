# Zamples Store Locator

Store locator that is using the google maps API.

### Example
Current working example can be found at the following site.

[Zing Bar Samples - Store Locator](https://https://zingbarsamples.com/locator/zingbarscom-plugin/locator.html)

### Current Usage
Simply call the jquery map script.
```
<script src="js/jquery.storelocator.js"></script>
```

### Requirements
* [jQuery]
* [Handlebars.js] - Only being used for simplicity.
* [mySQL] - All stores are being stored in mysql database.

### Code
Please review the code included in the following ```locator.html``` and then look at ```css\map.css``` for the styling properties.

Since this store locator map has already been built and is working, you will see that this is a realtively painless task. All that needs to be done is simply including this inside the new website and then adjusting the styling properties in the CSS.
